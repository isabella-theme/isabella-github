Isabella for Github.

You can use [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) to use this css.

I *will* eventually put this on userstyles.org for easy installation. But right now the skin isn't done and I'm not sure how many users ever bother to update styles once installed, so I'm waiting until things aren't broken before I put it there.

If you want to install it now, even though it's not done:

1. Copy the code from [here](https://github.com/isabella-theme/isabella-github/raw/master/isabella-github.css)
2. Click the Stylus icon in your toolbar and then click "Manage" in the menu that opens.
3. Click "Write new style" on the left.
4. Click "Import
5. Paste the code and then click "Overwrite style" at the bottom of the import dialog.
6. Name the style "Isabella for Github" or "isabella-github" and then click "Save"
